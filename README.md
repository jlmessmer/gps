Graph Paper Scissors (GPS)

GPS is a variant of the classic game Rock Paper Scissors with several key changes. First, the game is randomized, meaning that users
don't know which moves win against other moves. Secondly, it requires the winner of the previous game to move _first_, allowing the other
player to counter this move, adding an element of logic and strategy to the game. Lastly, it is extendable to an arbitrary number of possible
moves.
