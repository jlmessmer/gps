About GraphPaper-Scissors

GraphPaper-Scissors (GPS) is a variant of the classic game Rock-Paper-Scissors. It is unique in several rather interesting ways:

1) GPS can be played with an arbitrary number of possible moves, whereas Rock-Paper-Scissors has only 3
2) GPS hides which moves win against other moves. For example, in traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors, each player knows that Rock beats Scissors, which beats Paper, which beats Rock.

However, in GPS, this information is hidden from the player, so part of the challenge is to discover how the moves relate to each other.

3) Because of this added element of problem solving, GPS adds a mechanic where the winning player of the previous round must make their move _first_, rather than both players making their moves simultaneously.
